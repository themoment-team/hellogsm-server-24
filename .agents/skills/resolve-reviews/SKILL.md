## Step 1 — Collect PR Data

```bash
bash .agents/skills/resolve-reviews/scripts/get-pr-data.sh
```

Output files:
- `.pr-tmp/pr_comments.json` — inline review comments (id, path, line, body, user)
- `.pr-tmp/pr_changed_files.txt` — changed files
- `.pr-tmp/pr_commits.txt` — commits in this PR
- `.pr-tmp/pr_diff.txt` — full diff

Also fetch repo and PR metadata:

```bash
gh repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner
gh pr view --json number,baseRefName -q '{number: .number, base: .baseRefName}'
```

## Step 2 — Assess Each Comment

For each comment in `pr_comments.json`, apply the following **layered judgment criteria**:

### Judgment criteria (priority order)

1. **Project conventions** (primary): cross-reference CLAUDE.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
   - DTO annotation rules, commit scope, logging style, exception message format, etc.
2. **Language/framework best practices** (secondary): Kotlin official guide, Spring Boot recommendations
   - Apply only when no matching project rule exists

### Verdicts

- **VALID**: reviewer is correct → attempt auto code fix
- **INVALID**: reviewer is wrong with a clear refutation → skip, post refutation reply
- **PARTIAL**: intent is correct but application method or scope is ambiguous → confirm with AskUserQuestion

Always cite a specific source in the rationale (e.g. `CLAUDE.md §Logging Style`, `Kotlin: prefer val over var`).

## Step 3 — Act on Each Verdict

### VALID → Auto fix

1. Read the target file with the Read tool
2. Apply the reviewer's concern with the Edit tool
3. If the changes have not been committed yet, commit them
4. Record the short commit hash for use in Step 5:
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD
   ```

On failure: record the reason and fall back to PARTIAL.

### INVALID → Skip

Do not modify any code. Record the refutation rationale for Step 5.

### PARTIAL → Confirm with AskUserQuestion

Use the AskUserQuestion tool to ask:

```
⚠️ PARTIAL: [file:line] (reviewer)
Review: "..."
Rationale: ...
Accept? (y / n / s = skip for now)
```

- `y`: treat as VALID, attempt code fix
- `n`: treat as INVALID, skip
- `s` / other: record as PENDING

## Step 4 — Print Report

```
## resolve-reviews Results

| # | Reviewer | File | Verdict | Rationale | Action |
|---|----------|------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | alice | Foo.kt:12 | ✅ VALID | CLAUDE.md §Logging Style | Auto-fixed (abc1234) |
| 2 | bob | Bar.kt:34 | ❌ INVALID | CLAUDE.md §Exception Message | Skipped |
| 3 | alice | Baz.kt:56 | ⚠️ PARTIAL | - | PENDING |
```

## Step 5 — Push Commits

If any VALID fixes were committed in Step 3, push them before posting replies so the referenced commit hashes are visible on GitHub:

```bash
git push
```

## Step 6 — Post GitHub Replies

Post an inline reply for each comment. Always quote `path` and `comment_id` to prevent shell injection.

```bash
gh api "repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<pr_number>/comments/<comment_id>/replies" \
  -f body="<reply_body>"
```

For reply body templates, read `.agents/skills/resolve-reviews/references/reply-formats.md`.

## Step 7 — Cleanup

```bash
rm -rf .pr-tmp
```
